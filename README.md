* If you are using Linux/Mac OS, you can compile the code with the [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com). Use the command to compile and generate the executable

		make

* You may learn how to use [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) to set up the cross-platform build settings. Use the following commands to prepare the building environment, compile and generate the executable

		mkdir build; cd build
		cmake ..
		make
